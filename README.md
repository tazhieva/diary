# diary

This repository contains a basic iOS application that allows users to publish different types of content, including posts, thoughts, and memories. The app can be thought of as a "diary" where users can record their experiences and thoughts.

The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and utilizes the UIKit framework. Additionally, the app uses several third-party libraries to handle authentication, registration, and user data storage, including FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, and FirebaseStorage.

# Features
- User registration and authentication

- Ability to create, edit, and delete posts

- Support for different types of content, such as text, images

- Integration with Firebase services for data storage and retrieval

# Usage
Upon launching the application, users will be prompted to create an account or sign in with an existing account. Once authenticated, users can create new posts and view existing posts. Users can also edit or delete their own posts as needed.
